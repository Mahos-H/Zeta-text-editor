# Zeta-text-editor
## A simplistic C text editor
This code was inspired by snaptoken's blog on [Build Your Own Text Editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) who used [antirez's kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108) as a template. I took snaptoken's code and added functionalities for it to run without a `termios.h` header file and plain GCC compiler.

Note: Still under developement with a lot of room for improvement, most important being able to use arrow keys to move cursor.
